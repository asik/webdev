World record waves around 100ft (30m) rogue waves, largest waves world record Biggest wave in the world Large wave, swell storm tsunami, code, red, jaws, teahupoo\n\nBig wave surfing is the ultimate celebration of extreme surfing. Challenging deadly waves in harsh weather and ocean conditions takes a very serious approach.\nBig wave surfers are not interested in performance. Forget perfect cutbacks, stunning floaters or breathless aerial antics. The profile of a big wave rider is the result of several unparalleled personal characteristics.\n\nFear is always present in a 50-foot wave. Fear is the best way of managing the risk of paddling for a huge wave face, which doesn't tell you what is going to happen and how it is going to break.\n\nMonster waves tend to move quickly and force surfers to get away of the powerful whitewater. Big waves are lethal even for the most experienced extreme riders. The best big wave surf spots in the world have claimed several lives in the last decades.\n\nMalik Joyeux, Sion Milosky, Moto Watanabe, Mark Foo, Donnie Solomon, Todd Chesser, Dickie Cross and Peter Davi have passed away in extreme surfing conditions.

In the 1960's, waves like Pipeline and Waimea increased the popularity of paddling into new wave heights. Going over the falls was the daily menu.\n\nLaird Hamilton is the first professional big wave surfer. The waterman from Maui defies fast, hollow and high waves with a full-time training and previous preparation. Hamilton, the father of tow-in surfing, takes on the entire big wave spots of the Hawaiian Islands, in helicopter style.\n\nLaird was born with the gene of defying danger. He designs and prepares his own surfboards and wetsuits. Wherever heavy waves break, Hamilton is there to ride them: Mavericks, Cortes Bank, Dungeons.\n\n\nGarrett McNamara is one of the toughest big wave challengers. After riding a spectacular 78-foot wave in Nazaré, Portugal, the Hawaiian waterman entered the Guinness World Records with the biggest wave ever surfed.\n\nThe 55 best big wave surfers of all time is an exclusive extreme surfing club. From Jaws to Mavericks, Puerto Escondido, Punta Lobos, Ghost Trees, Belharra, Shipstern Bluff and Todos Santos, these riders have set up a new scale in the definition of giant waves.

Forget perfect cutbacks, stunning floaters or breathless aerial antics. The profile of a big wave rider is the result of several unparalleled personal characteristics.\n\nFear is always present in a 50-foot wave. Fear is the best way of managing the risk of paddling for a huge wave face, which doesn't tell you what is going to happen and how it is going to break.\n\nMonster waves tend to move quickly and force surfers to get away of the powerful whitewater. Big waves are lethal even for the most experienced extreme riders. The best big wave surf spots in the world have claimed several lives in the last decades.\n\nMalik Joyeux, Sion Milosky, Moto Watanabe, Mark Foo, Donnie Solomon, Todd Chesser, Dickie Cross and Peter Davi have passed away in extreme surfing conditions. Wipeouts, severe coral reef injuries and drowning are the most common causes of death in big wave surfing.\n\nThe pioneers of big wave surfing started to eye impossible killer rides in the 1940's. In the 1960's, waves like Pipeline and Waimea increased the popularity of paddling into new wave heights. Going over the falls was the daily menu.\n\nLaird Hamilton is the first professional big wave surfer. The waterman from Maui defies fast, hollow and high waves with a full-time training and previous preparation. Hamilton, the father of tow-in surfing, takes on the entire big wave spots of the Hawaiian Islands, in helicopter style.\n\nLaird was born with the gene of defying danger. He designs and prepares his own surfboards and wetsuits. Wherever heavy waves break, Hamilton is there to ride them: Mavericks, Cortes Bank, Dungeons.\n\n\nGarrett McNamara is one of the toughest big wave challengers. After riding a spectacular 78-foot wave in Nazaré, Portugal, the Hawaiian waterman entered the Guinness World Records with the biggest wave ever surfed.\n\nThe 55 best big wave surfers of all time is an exclusive extreme surfing club. From Jaws to Mavericks, Puerto Escondido, Punta Lobos, Ghost Trees, Belharra, Shipstern Bluff and Todos Santos, these riders have set up a new scale in the definition of giant waves. They are:\n\n\n***************************************************************            \nNo copyright infringement inteded and i don't have earnings from this video...\nIf you are the owner of this content (image or footage) and you want the delete of this video, please contact me inbox and i will do it immediately.\nAlso if you are the owner of this content (image or footage) and you wish, i can add your links in description (fb page, website, buy links etc)\n***************************************************************\n                                                 \n                                                \n\n\n\nAl Mennie\nAnthony Tashnick\nBen Wilkinson\nBob Pike\nBrock Little\nBuzzy Trent\nCarlos Burle\nChris Bertish\nDanilo Couto\nDarrick Doerner Darryl Virostko\nDave Kalama\nDave Wassel\nGabriel Villaran\nGarrett McNamara\nGeorge Downing\nBrad Gerlach\nGerry Lopez\nGrant Twiggy Baker Grant Washburn\nGreg Long\nGreg Noll\nIan Walsh\nJamie Sterling\nJay Moriarty\nJeff Clark\nJeff Rowley\nJose Angel\nJoão de Macedo\nKai Barger Keala Kennely\nKen Bradshaw\nKen Colllins\nKoby Abberton\nKohl Christensen\nLaird Hamilton\nLaurie Towner\nMark Foo\nMark Healey\nMark Mathews\nMark Visser Maya Gabeira\nMike Parsons\nNathan Fletcher\nPat Curren\nPeter Mel\nRamon Navarro\nRichie Fitzgerald\nRoss Clarke-Jones\nShane Dorian\nSion Milosky\nZach Wormhoudt $$$ huhi tsm windsurfing skt clg 7.16"

          "description": "“PENTACOASTAL” was inspired by the tonalities of Australian cult cinema. Directors Wade Goodall & Shane Fletcher have\nmerged these filmic elements within the body of a surf film through emotive animations, an undulating soundscape, and a\nsubliminal narrative which follows a quasi-recursive map depicted by a pentagram drawn on the map of Australia.\n\n“A recollection of Australasian exploration following a quasi-recursive map, with elemental moments of expressive wave worship.”\n\nFeaturing Wade Goodall, Dane Reynolds, Harry Bryant, Nathan Fletcher, Pat Gudauskas, Dylan Graves, Nathan Florence, Tanner Gudauskas & Kyuss King\n\nMusic Credits:\nSoundtrack by Grinderman, 35007, Brian Jonestown Massacre, Windhand, Goons of Doom, plus original compositions from Black Waves, Thom Pringle, Nathan Fletcher, Shane Fletcher and more.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/1aIFFTY\n\nAbout Vans Surf:\nVideos from the Vans Surf Team.\nSurf Team Members: \nNathan Fletcher, Joel Tudor, Dane Reynolds, Wade Goodall, Leila Hurst, Pat Gudauskas, Dane Gudauskas, Tanner Gudauskas, Nathan Florence, Dylan Graves, Ivan Florence, Alex Knost.\n\nDiscover more Vans Surf Content: http://bit.ly/2cnotKY \nConnect with Vans Surf: http://bit.ly/2ceZs7H \nTumblr: http://bit.ly/1MsG68p \nInstagram: http://bit.ly/2bOHwwn \nTwitter: http://bit.ly/2c2Xp3e\n\nConnect with Vans: http://bit.ly/1uPubcu\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/29CDdc4\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/29AT0Gz\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/29wXHB5\nPinterest: http://bit.ly/29tf1Gs\nTumblr: http://bit.ly/1Rjvlt7\n\nAbout Vans:\nVans®, a VF Corporation (NYSE: VFC) brand, is the original action sports footwear, apparel and accessories brand.
